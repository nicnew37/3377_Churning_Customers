# 3377_Churning_Customers
This AI project utilizes a deep learning model implementing the Keras functional API to predict customer churn in a phone service. 
The model assesses the probability of a customer churning by expressing its confidence in this outcome. The prediction is determined by analyzing 12 customer features such as contract type, total charges, online security, etc.
To construct and train the model, I utilize essential libraries, including scikit-learn, the Keras framework, the scikeras library, and others. The deployment of the model is accomplished using Streamlit.
The app functionality from the work  is illustrated as follows  : https://youtu.be/v3JJcPB28ko
